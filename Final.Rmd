## Abstract  

In this project, I analyze Smith and Martin (2017)'s "Political Dynasties and the Selection of Cabinet Ministers". I begin by replicating Smith and Martin (2017)'s figures and tables. While some of this output cannot be replicated due to missing data or the inability to reproduce in R (the authors used Stata), I find similar results to the authors in what was producible. From there, I extend the results by using their dataset to analyze the gendered impact of two covariates, dynasty and local experience, on winning election.  

## Introduction  

The importance of political dynasties in legislatures cannot be understated.  

## Literature Review  

Whether these dynasties are beneficial is another question entirely.  

## Why Ireland?  

Closely choose candidates, weak parties, multimember districts, explain STV.  

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# I load in three libraries. The first, lfe, allows me to regress using absorbed
# fixed effects (similar to the absorb function in Stata). The second, stargazer,
# lets me create regression output tables. The third is tidyverse, which is useful
# when wrangling with data.

library(lfe)
library(stargazer)
library(tidyverse)

# Smith and Martin leave two data files in the Dataverse. Both of them contain the same
# data. Since I'm more familiar with reading in a csv file versus a dta file (and I
# want to limit the libraries called), I read in their csv data in as csv_data.

csv_data <- read_csv("Smith-Martin-Replication-Data/IRELAND-CANDIDATES.csv")

```


```{r data cleaning, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Smith and Martin recode a lot of values before going into their analysis.

csv_data <- csv_data %>% 

# The first mutate is a scalar value of whether a politician is a legacy. What are these
# values? pre_mp is equal to 1 if past family members were elected to the Dail
# (Ireland's) lower house. cablegacy is coded 1 if their direct predecessor served in
# cabinet. All other values on this scale are equal to 0.
  
  mutate(legacyscale = case_when(cablegacy == 1 ~ 2,
                                 pre_mp == 1 ~ 1,
                                 TRUE ~ 0),

# I then add a dynasty variable for my extension. This is a binary equal to 1 if the 
# candidate qualifies as a dynasty.
         
         dynasty = case_when(legacyscale > 0 ~ 1,
                             TRUE ~ 0),
  
# cwins is the number of times (including the current term) the candidate has won
# election to the Dail. est_age is the estimated age of each candidate (if unknown) or
# the actual age (which is found in age). This age is taken from when the candidate
# runs/wins for the first time. Presumably Smith and Martin wanted to see if these
# numbers are still influential on an exponential scale.

         cwins2 = cwins^2,
        est_age2 = est_age^2,
        age2 = age^2,

# Then we have to recode some values already in the dataset into groups. The first is
# a group of estimated ages. The next is recoding educode to new values. educode refers
# to the highest degree received. 1 is primary school, 2 is secondary school, 3 is 
# tertiary, 4 university, and 5 postgraduate. They recode tertiary and university to have
# the same value in educode2.

                             TRUE ~ as.double(educode)),

# offprof is whether the candidate had an "official" profession (which I think refers to
# a senior level). I code that using a case_when.

        offprof = case_when(iscoid < 3 ~ 1,
                            TRUE ~ 0),

# I also found it really helpful to recode legacyscale as the actual name values used in
# graphing (nonlegacy, noncabinet legacy, and cabinet legacy). I assign this to
# legacyname.

                               legacyscale == 2 ~ "Cabinet legacy"),

# The next recode focuses on the Dail term. There had been 32 Dail terms by 2016, but 
# the current dataset only looks at them as the term number. Since these terms have
# varying lengths, recoding them into years may yield stronger results on legacy.

## Replication  

Smith and Martin (2017) use Stata to create the 7 tables and 6 figures in the paper. As a result, my output does not perfectly match their paper cosmetically. That said, the results are the same (save that the graphs look a bit better and some of the regression numbers are ever so slightly off). Smith and Martin (2017) fail to include replication code to create Tables 1 or 2. The replication code create Figure 5 cannot be translated into R. Although I may try producing them on my own later, I am skipping them for now.  

### Figures  

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Figure 1 is a stacked bar plot looking at the proportion of legacies among
# candidates, elected TDs, TDs in the coalition party, and cabinet ministers.

# required me to make percentages of legacy status among each of the four 
# politician categories outlined above.

## Extension  

I will extend Smith and Martin (2017) in two ways: analyzing the gendered effect of dynasties on winning election and looking at the effect of another potentially gendered covariate, local experience, on winning election.  

### Gendered Effect of Dynasty  

Smith and Martin (2017) note that "legacies of both types are more likely to be women, which suggests that dynasties may be a significant pathway into politics for female candidate in an otherwise male-dominated parliament" (p. 151). This observation inspired me to dig deeper into the gendered effects of being in a political dynasty. Does being in a dynasty help female candidates counteract the gender gap in winning elections?  

To answer this question, I manipulated the Smith and Martin (2017) dataset to include a binary varible, `dynasty`, that was coded 1 if the candidate qualified as a dynasty. I then regressed election result on that and the candidate's sex. I ended up with three models: one that had no fixed effects, one that used the party-year fixed effects from Smith and Martin (2017), and one that used the authors' district-year fixed effects. That output is below in Table X.  

That said, it must be mentioned that this analysis is not unique. After creating my models, I found that one of the co-authors of the initial paper, Daniel Smith, currently has a working paper that studies this same topic with a similar dataset using approximately the same modeling technique. As a result, this portion of the extension should be characterized as a replication of Folke, Rickne, and Smith (2017) since, while I did not know it at the time, they were the first to flesh out this idea. This portion of the extension also serves as a replication of Folke, Rickne, and Smith (2017) who, with a similar dataset to Smith and Martin (2017), question whether there is a gender-specific impact to being a legacy in terms of winning election.  

The major difference between my analysis and Folke, Rickne, and Smith (2017) is that they restrict their sample to Ireland's three major parties (Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, and Labour). They justify this decision because those parties have been consistently nominating candidates in most districts. However, I think the results should still hold without subsetting the data in this fashion because (a) there is still a model that creates party-year fixed effects and (b) since Ireland's electoral system places an emphasis on individual candidates, it should not necessarily matter that a party was consistently nominating in each district.  

```{r extension 1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

library(lfe)
library(stargazer)

te1_1 <- felm(result ~ female*dynasty, data=csv_data)

te1_2 <- felm(result ~ female*dynasty | party_dail, data=csv_data)

te1_3 <- felm(result ~ female*dynasty | dist_year, data=csv_data)

te1 <- stargazer(te1_1, te1_2, te1_3,
                 title = "Table X: Gendered Effect of Dynasty",
                 header=FALSE,
                 add.lines = list(c("Fixed Effects?", "No", "Party-Year", "District-Year")),
                 covariate.labels = c("Female",
                                      "Dynasty",
                                      "Female * Dynasty"),
                 dep.var.caption = "Dependent Variable:",
                 dep.var.labels = "Election Result")
```


### Gendered Effect of Local Experience  

I then wondered whether other covariates could have differing effects by gender. I thought local political experience was an interesting covariate to study because there seem to be two schools of thought surrounding its gendered effects.  

The first is pessimistic. Okimoto and Brescoll (2010) observe that female candidates seen as ambitious are punished by voters, while male candidates seen in a similar light are not penalized. Excluding a general "feeling" potential voters could get after meeting a candidate face-to-face or watching them in a debate, local experience seems to be the best signal for ambition available to study. While the overall effect of holding local office is positive for men, the effect for women would be expected to be diminished or even negative if the "ambition hypothesis" holds.  

The second possibility is more optimistic about the effect of local experience on female representation, even though it relies on a sexist electorate. Survey data from Fox (2003) demonstrates that fewer women run for office than men because they are more pessimistic about their qualifications. Additionally, research from Huddy and Terkildsen (1993) suggests that female candidates are held to a higher standard than male candidates in elections. It follows, then, that local experience can both incentivize better female candidates to run and give them the extra qualifications necessary to beat male candidates. In fact, if the assumptions prove true, female candidates should gain more benefit from local experience than male candidates do since the electorate seemingly demands more qualifications from women before voting them into office. As a result, the effect of women holding local office should counteract the gender gap.  

To determine which of these hypotheses most accurately reflected the data, I recreated the models from the first extension and applied them to the interaction between candidate sex and local political experience. Again, three models were created: one without fixed effects, one taking party-year effects into account, and one taking district-year effects into account. As in the first extension, I did not subset the data to only include the major parties. The results of the models are summarized below in Table X.  

```{r extension 2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

te2_1 <- felm(result ~ female*local, data=csv_data)

te2_2 <- felm(result ~ female*local | party_dail, data=csv_data)

te2_3 <- felm(result ~ female*local | dist_year, data=csv_data)

te2 <- stargazer(te2_1, te2_2, te2_3,
                 title = "Table X: Gendered Effect of Local Experience",
                 header=FALSE,
                 add.lines = list(c("Fixed Effects?", "No", "Party-Year", "District-Year")),
                 covariate.labels = c("Female",
                                      "Local Experience",
                                      "Female * Local Experience"),
                 dep.var.caption = "Dependent Variable:",
                 dep.var.labels = "Election Result")
```
