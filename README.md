# Gov-1006-Final

This is Jack Schroeder's final project for Gov 1006: Models.

The project consists of a replication, extension, and write-up concerning ["Political Dynasties and the Selection of Cabinet Ministers"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lsq.12146) by Daniel Smith and Shane Martin.
