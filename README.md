# Gov-1006-Final

This is Jack Schroeder's final project for Gov 1006: Models.

The project consists of a replication, extension, and write-up concerning ["Political Dynasties and the Selection of Cabinet Ministers"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lsq.12146) by Daniel Smith and Shane Martin.

The data was retrieved from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5Y5148).

This repo contains the following:
* `Smith-Martin-2017.pdf`, a copy of the paper
* `Final.Rmd`, which currently attempts to replicate the paper's findings
* `Smith-Martin-Replication-Data`, a folder containing Smith and Martin's replication data:
  * `IRELAND-CANDIDATES.csv`, the master dataset containing information on elected Irish officials
  * `IRELAND-CANDIDATES.dta`, a Stata version of the same dataset
  * `IRELAND-CANDIDATES-Codebook.docx`, which lists and describes each variable in the above datasets
  * `Smith-Martin-2017-LSQ-Replication.do`, the Stata replication code
  * `Smith-Martin-2017-LSQ-Appendix.pdf`, the online appendix of the paper
* `references.bib`, a bibliography that currently does not function properly
* A `.gitignore` file
* and `README.md`, which you are now finished reading
